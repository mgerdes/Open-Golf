Example
=======

Here's a basic sample program which starts a second thread which just waits and prints a message.

    #define  THREAD_IMPLEMENTATION
    #include "thread.h"

    #include <stdio.h> // for printf
    
    int thread_proc( void* user_data)
        {
        thread_timer_t timer;
        thread_timer_init( &timer );

        int count = 0;
        thread_atomic_int_t* exit_flag = (thread_atomic_int_t*) user_data;
        while( thread_atomic_int_load( exit_flag ) == 0 )
            {
            printf( "Thread... " );
            thread_timer_wait( &timer, 1000000000 ); // sleep for a second
            ++count;
            }

        thread_timer_term( &timer );
        printf( "Done\n" );
        return count;
        }

    int main( int argc, char** argv )
        {
        (void) argc, argv;
        
        thread_atomic_int_t exit_flag;
        thread_atomic_int_store( &exit_flag, 0 );

        thread_ptr_t thread = thread_create0( thread_proc, &exit_flag, "Example thread", THREAD_STACK_SIZE_DEFAULT );

        thread_timer_t timer;
        thread_timer_init( &timer );
        for( int i = 0; i < 5; ++i )
            {
            printf( "Main... " );
            thread_timer_wait( &timer, 2000000000 ); // sleep for two seconds
            }
        thread_timer_term( &timer );
        
        thread_atomic_int_store( &exit_flag, 1 ); // signal thread to exit
        int retval = thread_join( thread );

        printf( "Count: %d\n", retval );

        thread_destroy( thread );
        return retval;
        }


API Documentation
=================

thread.h is a single-header library, and does not need any .lib files or other binaries, or any build scripts. To use it,
you just include thread.h to get the API declarations. To get the definitions, you must include thread.h from *one* 
single C or C++ file, and #define the symbol `THREAD_IMPLEMENTATION` before you do. 


Customization
-------------
thread.h allows for specifying the exact type of 64-bit unsigned integer to be used in its API. By default, it is 
defined as `unsigned long long`, but as this is not a standard type on all compilers, you can redefine it by #defining 
THREAD_U64 before including thread.h. This is useful if you, for example, use the types from `<stdint.h>` in the rest of 
your program, and you want thread.h to use compatible types. In this case, you would include thread.h using the 
following code:

    #define THREAD_U64 uint64_t
    #include "thread.h"

Note that when customizing this data type, you need to use the same definition in every place where you include 
thread.h, as it affect the declarations as well as the definitions.


thread_current_thread_id
------------------------

    thread_id_t thread_current_thread_id( void )

Returns a unique identifier for the calling thread. After the thread terminates, the id might be reused for new threads.


thread_yield
------------

    void thread_yield( void )

Makes the calling thread yield execution to another thread. The operating system controls which thread is switched to.


thread_set_high_priority
------------------------

    void thread_set_high_priority( void )

When created, threads are set to run at normal priority. In some rare cases, such as a sound buffer update loop, it can
be necessary to have one thread of your application run on a higher priority than the rest. Calling 
`thread_set_high_priority` will raise the priority of the calling thread, giving it a chance to be run more often.
Do not increase the priority of a thread unless you absolutely have to, as it can negatively affect performance if used
without care.


thread_exit
-----------

    void thread_exit( int return_code )

Exits the calling thread, as if you had done `return return_code;` from the main body of the thread function.


thread_create0
-------------

    thread_ptr_t thread_create0( int (*thread_proc)( void* ), void* user_data, char const* name, int stack_size )

Creates a new thread running the `thread_proc` function, passing the `user_data` through to it. The thread will be 
given the debug name given in the `name` parameter, if supported on the platform, and it will have the stack size
specified in the `stack_size` parameter. To get the operating system default stack size, use the defined constant
`THREAD_STACK_SIZE_DEFAULT`. When returning from the thread_proc function, the value you return can be received in
another thread by calling thread_join. `thread_create0` returns a pointer to the thread instance, which can be used 
as a parameter to the functions `thread_destroy` and `thread_join`.


thread_destroy
--------------

    void thread_destroy( thread_ptr_t thread )

Destroys a thread that was created by calling `thread_create0`. Make sure the thread has exited before you attempt to 
destroy it. This can be accomplished by calling `thread_join`. It is not possible for force termination of a thread by
calling `thread_destroy`.


thread_join
-----------

    int thread_join( thread_ptr_t thread )

Waits for the specified thread to exit. Returns the value which the thread returned when exiting.


thread_mutex_init
-----------------
    
    void thread_mutex_init( thread_mutex_t* mutex )

Initializes the specified mutex instance, preparing it for use. A mutex can be used to lock sections of code, such that
it can only be run by one thread at a time.


thread_mutex_term
-----------------

    void thread_mutex_term( thread_mutex_t* mutex )

Terminates the specified mutex instance, releasing any system resources held by it.


thread_mutex_lock
-----------------

    void thread_mutex_lock( thread_mutex_t* mutex )

Takes an exclusive lock on a mutex. If the lock is already taken by another thread, `thread_mutex_lock` will yield the
calling thread and wait for the lock to become available before returning. The mutex must be initialized by calling
`thread_mutex_init` before it can be locked.


thread_mutex_unlock
-------------------

    void thread_mutex_unlock( thread_mutex_t* mutex )

Releases a lock taken by calling `thread_mutex_lock`. 


thread_signal_init
------------------

    void thread_signal_init( thread_signal_t* signal )

Initializes the specified signal instance, preparing it for use. A signal works like a flag, which can be waited on by
one thread, until it is raised from another thread. 


thread_signal_term
------------------

    void thread_signal_term( thread_signal_t* signal )

Terminates the specified signal instance, releasing any system resources held by it.


thread_signal_raise
-------------------

    void thread_signal_raise( thread_signal_t* signal )

Raise the specified signal. Other threads waiting for the signal will proceed.  


thread_signal_wait
------------------

    int thread_signal_wait( thread_signal_t* signal, int timeout_ms )

Waits for a signal to be raised, or until `timeout_ms` milliseconds have passed. If the wait timed out, a value of 0 is
returned, otherwise a non-zero value is returned. If the `timeout_ms` parameter is THREAD_SIGNAL_WAIT_INFINITE, 
`thread_signal_wait` waits indefinitely.


thread_atomic_int_load
----------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_load( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic )

Returns the value of `atomic` as an atomic operation.

thread_atomic_int_inc
---------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_inc( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic )

Increments the value of `atomic` by one, as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_int_dec
---------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_dec( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic )

Decrements the value of `atomic` by one, as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_int_add
---------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_add( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic, int value )

Adds the specified value to `atomic`, as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_int_sub
---------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_sub( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic, int value )

Subtracts the specified value to `atomic`, as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_int_swap
----------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_swap( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic, int desired )

Sets the value of `atomic` as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_int_compare_and_swap
----------------------------------

    int thread_atomic_int_compare_and_swap( thread_atomic_int_t* atomic, int expected, int desired )

Compares the value of `atomic` to the value of `expected`, and if they match, sets the vale of `atomic` to `desired`,
all as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_ptr_load
----------------------

    void* thread_atomic_ptr_load( thread_atomic_ptr_t* atomic )

Returns the value of `atomic` as an atomic operation.


thread_atomic_ptr_store
-----------------------

    void thread_atomic_ptr_store( thread_atomic_ptr_t* atomic, void* desired )

thread_atomic_ptr_swap
----------------------

    void* thread_atomic_ptr_swap( thread_atomic_ptr_t* atomic, void* desired )

Sets the value of `atomic` as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_atomic_ptr_compare_and_swap
----------------------------------

    void* thread_atomic_ptr_compare_and_swap( thread_atomic_ptr_t* atomic, void* expected, void* desired )

Compares the value of `atomic` to the value of `expected`, and if they match, sets the vale of `atomic` to `desired`,
all as an atomic operation. Returns the value `atomic` had before the operation.


thread_timer_init
-----------------
    
    void thread_timer_init( thread_timer_t* timer )

Initializes the specified timer instance, preparing it for use. A timer can be used to sleep a thread for a high 
precision duration.


thread_timer_term
-----------------

    void thread_timer_term( thread_timer_t* timer )

Terminates the specified timer instance, releasing any system resources held by it.


thread_timer_wait
-----------------

    void thread_timer_wait( thread_timer_t* timer, THREAD_U64 nanoseconds )

Waits until `nanoseconds` amount of time have passed, before returning.


thread_tls_create
-----------------
    
    thread_tls_t thread_tls_create( void )

Creates  a thread local storage (TLS) index. Once created, each thread has its own value for that TLS index, which can
be set or retrieved individually.


thread_tls_destroy
------------------
    
    void thread_tls_destroy( thread_tls_t tls )

Destroys the specified TLS index. No further calls to `thread_tls_set` or `thread_tls_get` are valid after this.


thread_tls_set
--------------

    void thread_tls_set( thread_tls_t tls, void* value )

Stores a value in the calling thread's slot for the specified TLS index. Each thread has its own value for each TLS 
index.


thread_tls_get
--------------

    void* thread_tls_get( thread_tls_t tls )

Retrieves the value from the calling thread's slot for the specified TLS index. Each thread has its own value for each 
TLS index.


thread_queue_init
-----------------

    void thread_queue_init( thread_queue_t* queue, int size, void** values, int count )

Initializes the specified queue instance, preparing it for use. The queue is a lock-free (but not wait-free)
single-producer/single-consumer queue - it will not acquire any locks as long as there is space for adding or items to
be consume, but will lock and wait when there is not. The `size` parameter specifies the number of elements in the 
queue. The `values` parameter is an array of queue slots (`size` elements in length), each being of type `void*`. If
the queue is initially empty, the `count` parameter should be 0, otherwise it indicates the number of entires, from the
start of the `values` array, that the queue is initialized with. The `values` array is not copied, and must remain valid
until `thread_queue_term` is called.


thread_queue_term
-----------------

    void thread_queue_term( thread_queue_t* queue )

Terminates the specified queue instance, releasing any system resources held by it.


thread_queue_produce
--------------------

    int thread_queue_produce( thread_queue_t* queue, void* value, int timeout_ms )

Adds an element to a single-producer/single-consumer queue. If there is space in the queue to add another element, no
lock will be taken. If the queue is full, calling thread will sleep until an element is consumed from another thread, 
before adding the element, or until `timeout_ms` milliseconds have passed. If the wait timed out, a value of 0 is 
returned, otherwise a non-zero value is returned. If the `timeout_ms` parameter is THREAD_QUEUE_WAIT_INFINITE,  
`thread_queue_produce` waits indefinitely.


thread_queue_consume
--------------------

    void* thread_queue_consume( thread_queue_t* queue, int timeout_ms )

Removes an element from a single-producer/single-consumer queue. If the queue contains at least one element, no lock 
will be taken. If the queue is empty, the calling thread will sleep until an element is added from another thread, or 
until `timeout_ms` milliseconds have passed. If the wait timed out, a value of NULL is returned, otherwise 
`thread_queue_consume` returns the value that was removed from the queue. If the `timeout_ms` parameter is 
THREAD_QUEUE_WAIT_INFINITE, `thread_queue_consume` waits indefinitely.


thread_queue_count
------------------

    int thread_queue_count( thread_queue_t* queue )

Returns the number of elements currently held in a single-producer/single-consumer queue. Be aware that by the time you
get the count, it might have changed by another thread calling consume or produce, so use with care.
